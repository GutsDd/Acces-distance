## Description

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to secure communications between two machines, typically over an unsecured network like the Internet. It allows users to access a remote machine and execute commands as if they were local. The protocol includes integrated protocols such as SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers. It supports various authentication mechanisms, including passwords, public keys, and certificates, and provides strong encryption to protect against eavesdropping and connection hijacking.
